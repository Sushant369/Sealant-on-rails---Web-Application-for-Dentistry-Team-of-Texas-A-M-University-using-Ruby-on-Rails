# README

* Ruby version - 3.2.2

* Rails version - 7.0.8

* System dependencies: Linux_84x for Heroku

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite: We have cucumber and rspec tests currently. So for cucumber tests run cucumber-rails. For rspec tests run rspec.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions : Connect Heroku to GitHub Repo ( Sealant-On-Rails ) and click deploy. We have added procfile, which runs specific rake tasks related to building database migration. More rake task will come in to implement CI/CD Pipeline. 

To deploy locally. Clone the repo. Run the rails-3.2.2 version. Run gem install bundler. Run bundle install. Run db:migrate. Run rails s. The app should work :)

Project Detials:

Revolutionizing dental sealant program: Replace paper-based data with interactive software for Texas A&M School of Dentistry. #HealthTech

Project Name: School Sealant Program Data Management System

Organization: Texas A&M School of Dentistry

Contact: Dr. Amal Noureldin (anoureldin@tamu.edu)

Description:

The Texas A&M School of Dentistry oversees a Sealants Program dedicated to providing free dental sealants to elementary school children. Currently, the program relies on paper-based data collection sheets for dental screening and charting, with manual data entry into Excel sheets stored on Microsoft Teams. We are embarking on a project to revolutionize this process with an interactive software application.

Project Goals:

Our primary objectives are as follows:

Efficient Data Capture: Develop a user-friendly software or app that allows faculty and students to digitally capture data during dental screenings and sealant applications. Automated Data Entry: Implement a feature that auto-populates numerical data to eliminate manual data entry errors and streamline the process. Data Analysis: Provide quick and interactive analysis tools to evaluate the effectiveness of our School Sealant Program. Additional Information:

Currently, our faculty and students visit elementary schools to conduct dental screenings and apply sealants to children. Data collected during these visits is recorded on paper forms, creating a cumbersome manual entry process for our program coordinator. The envisioned software or app will simplify this workflow and enhance data security.

Key Features:

User-friendly interface for data capture during dental screenings. Automation of data entry to reduce errors and save time. Robust analysis tools for evaluating program effectiveness. Secure data storage and access control to protect sensitive information. Compliance with best practices in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Technology Stack:

The project will be developed using Ruby on Rails, as recommended by Prof. Ritchey, to ensure functionality and security. We will focus on designing a system with security as a core element from the outset, safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) at rest and restricting access to authorized users.

By investing in this School Sealant Program Data Management System, we aim to enhance the efficiency of our program, improve data accuracy, and ultimately provide better dental care to elementary school children. Your support and collaboration are essential to making this project a success.

For further details, including project specifications and outcome measures, please feel free to contact Dr. Amal Noureldin (anoureldin@tamu.edu). We are excited to embark on this journey toward a more effective and secure data management solution for our School Sealant Program.
